<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>
    <h5>Data Analyst Volunteer, AMS1ONE Solutions,</h5>
     Jan 2023-Present<br/>

Additionally, I am analysing data sets using Excel, SQL, and Microsoft Power BI to identify trends and insights. As part of my work, I have created and maintained data dashboards to track program performance and success metrics, which has resulted in a 20% increase in program efficiency.

    <h5>Desktop Engineer , A24 Group,</h5> 	
     Sep 2021 – Dec 2022<br/>
    As a technical support I was responsible to handle calls, troubleshoot technical issues, and resolve incidents. This involves listening carefully to the caller's issue and identifying the root cause of the problem, then providing a solution that is appropriate for the situation. I was also the first point of contact for all technical issues that are escalated to the service desk. This means that if an issue cannot be resolved at the first level of support, it is escalated for further investigation and resolution. I work closely with other members of the IT team to ensure that all issues are resolved in a timely and efficient manner. In addition to providing remote support, I also provide face-to-face support  to troubleshoot a problem, or providing training on how to use a particular software tool.
    
    <h5>Medical Assistant , HealthCare  Setting,</h5>      
     Jul 2010 – Aug 2021<br/>
    As a medical assistant, I am responsible for taking patient histories and recording vital signs, such as blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. Additionally, I perform basic lab tests and prepare specimens for testing. I assist doctors with medical procedures, such as minor surgeries or examinations. In addition, I provide medication administration and patient education on how to take medication and any potential side effects. Lastly, I provide translation services for non-English speaking patients, particularly those who speak French, to ensure they receive the same high level of care as all other patients.
